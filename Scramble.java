// Exercise 7

/*
 * use the letters to spell words;
 * 
Imagine you are given your set of tiles as a string, like "quijibo",
and you are given another string to test, like "jib". 
Write a method called canSpell that takes two strings and 
checks whether the set of tiles can spell the word. 
You might have more than one tile with the same letter, 
but you can only use each tile once.

// take two string and one of them make to be in the scope or same letters to become true
